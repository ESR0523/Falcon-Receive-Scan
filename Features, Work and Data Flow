Interface #1:  Set delivery date, scan, retrieve routeID, stop detail
Interface #2:  Set delivery date, scan, retrieve routeID (no detail)
Interface #3:  Set delivery date, set routeID, scan, retrieve stop detail

Interface #1:
Set delivery date with date picker
Scan barcode
  Lookup barcode in these tables.columns, in this order
    tblOrder.Reference1  if no match
    tblOrder.Reference2  if no match
    tblOrder.OrderID
  Successful match gives user indication, sound and visible on screen
  Unsuccessful gives user indication, sound, visible "no match"

Successful scan
  Updates tblOrderStatus.Confirmed with dbo.getCXTdate()
          tblOrderStatus.AtOrigin with dbo.getCXTdate()
          tblOrderStatus.PickedUp with dbo.getCXTdate()
  (NOTE:  In future iterations these fields will be updated with different scans)
  Updates tblOrder.DueTimeTo with date selected with date picker + 21:00
  Updates tblOrderRouteStops.PostDate with date selected with date picker
  (orders are created with future dates as product often does not arrive on time so date change is necessary)
  Updates tblOrder.SpecialInst with 'FXTSCAN mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm'
  If already delivered, deletes from tblOrderStatus.Delivered and tblOrderStatus.POD (may remove this function, TBD)

Display shows
  Text of barcode, RouteID, delivery date

Interface #2 functions just as Interface #1 except the screen only shows RouteID in very large text

Interface #3 performs all of the same functions except.
  Successful scan moves order to the RouteID selected, typically an 'OVERFLOW' route.
  Updates tblOrder.SpecialInst with 'FxtSetRoute mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm' + SpecialInst
